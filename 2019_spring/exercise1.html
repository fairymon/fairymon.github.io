<b>This book is designed for people who wants to enjoy their relaxing moment in their daily lives with a glass a wine, paired with a perfect food.</b> Wine not only uplifts people’s moods, but also supports our body, when consumed with right amount. To maximize its benefits, the importance of pairing of food and wine it is needless to say.
Wines are divide to specific categories, such as red wines, white wines, rose, champagne, and dessert wine, based on the method and types of grapes that were used. Since each wine has different tastes in sweetness, acidity, body, and fruity, flavors of wines are identical and they have specific pairing to each food. The number one guideline is to bring out the best characteristics of a wine. I would like to introduce few simple guidelines when finding a perfect fair for your wine.
<br>
<br>
First of all, since our taste buds are very sensitive to bitterness, it’s important not to overwhelm that sensitivity by pairing bitter food with high tannin wine. Green Beans with Cabernet Sauvignon will multiply bitter tastes.
If you want to pair a high tannin wine, look to foods with fat, umami, and salt for balance.
<br>
<br>
Second of all, as a general rule, make sure that the wine is sweeter than the food it is accompanying and you will have a successful wine pairing. If the wine is less sweet than the food it’s matched with, it will tend to taste bitter
and tart.
<br>
<br>
Third of all, a wine should have higher acidity than the food it’s matched with, otherwise it will taste flabby. For instance, a salad with vinaigrette is better with an extra brut Champagne than a buttery Chardonnay.
