  The book was simply made of restyling a simple story in to different styles. The excerpt I read showed six different ways to tell a same story in a different way; such as Notation, Double Entry, Litotes, Metaphorically, Retrograde, and Surprises. I was such as interesting experience to see show the style changes the whole mood of the story, and also amazed that the author could show 99 different ways.
<br>
The method of conveying a same story in a different way portrayed me a fresh and impressive feelings about the each revisions. Showing a new perspective to audience is an effective way to convey not only the content what we want to show, but also the style and the mood that we think should go along.
<br>
For those reasons, whenever we show our project, we should think about how to show our work to others. This is because certain characteristic styles can totally change the overall view of the work.
<br>
 What type of writing style was your favorite in the reading? Whatâ€™s the reason for that?
<br>
If you build you own website, which style would you go for?
